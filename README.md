# pygame-labbing

I'm taking a summer to improve how I code in Python by working on pygame.

Some topics I'm planning on working on are:

- start using `ruff`
- continue using `uv`
- improve design pattern knowledge ([book](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com))
- improve testing ([book](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781617296277))
